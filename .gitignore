# .gitignore (Keep unnecessary files out of the repository)
# ============================================================

# REQ.UNIVERSAL: All professional GitHub project repositories MUST include .gitignore.
# WHY: Prevent committing generated artifacts, local state, secrets, and OS-specific files.
# ALT: Repository may customize ignores, but MUST preserve universal safety rules.
# CUSTOM: Logs may be temporarily committed for verification; keep ignored for
# production use and security.


# === Universal (all projects, all languages) ===

# WHY: Logs are useful during debugging and verification.
# ALT: Comment if logs must be inspected or validated.

# === VS Code (special case) ===

.vscode/

# WHY: Commit recommended extensions (opt-in) for consistent development experience.
# NOTE: Share recommendations, not personal editor styles or preferences.
